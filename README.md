## Problem 1
- Scenario: {Stadium}
- Assumptions:
  - Other teams are willing to try dirty stuff to beat my team.
- Assets:
  - The fairness of each football game, which is guaranteed by the fact that
    all players are not affected by drugs. Since football game is sort of
    examining if the players are strong, taking drugs for the game is like
    cheating that will make the players banned.
  - The sports spirit of each football game, that players from all teams are
    trying to win instead of deliberately trying to lose. If players from a
    team try to deliberately lose scores and let the other team win, this is
    violating the sports spirit and making the game meaningless.
- Threats:
  - Malicious teams may try to use drugs to break the fairness and win the
    games. Drugs make athletes more excited and exhibit better strength in the
    games such that they can win the games easier.
  - Malicious teams may also exploit the fact that players using drugs will be
    banned from games. Therefore, they could secretly put drugs in opposite
    teams' food or drinks, letting them get tested to violating the fairness
    and banned from games.
  - Players may involve in gambling by betting their own teams' loss.
    Meanwhile, they participate in the games, trying to lose scores seemingly
    from mistakes but actually on purpose.
  - Referees may get biased and cater to one team in the game, which makes the
    game unfair.
- Countermeasures:
  - The stadium offer uranium test against drugs to avoid threat #1. This
    should be cheap and only requires hiring doctors with expertise.
  - The stadium can offer both food and drinks free from drugs. Additionally,
    people can still put drugs into open food or water bottles. In response,
    the stadium can put monitors to cover all places. Therefore, teams can
    freely enjoy food and drinks without getting drugs put in by malicious
    opposite teams. Putting monitors is cheap, but detecting if malicious
    people are putting drugs in other people's food is hard and costly. The
    benefit is that it can psychologically prevent people doing that malicious
    thing.
  - The stadium can selectively hire referees who have no conflict of
    interests with both teams. This only involves some investigation that
    would be cheap.
  - The stadium may ask experts tell from the game if players are trying to
    lose the game on purpose. If so, investigations can start on whether they
    involve in gambling. The second step is costly but the first step may
    effectively prevent people doing that.
